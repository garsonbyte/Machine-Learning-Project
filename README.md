# Machine Learning Project
To Do:  
- ***Format with text blocks (While we write the report)
- Bar Graphs (Comparing 4 algorithms: Logistic, SVM, PCA_Logistic, PCA_SVM) ->finished. 
- ***Confusion matrices (on python) -> finished. 
- ***Did we ever do linear regression with PCA? Nope.

- Have not finished logistic regression 
- Conclusion 

Powerpoint: 
- Have not started 

Tables are completed! 
    Tables: 
        Linear Regression: 
            - Overall (final) results
            - Native Bayes 
            - L1 Regularization
            - L2 Regularization 
        SVM: 
            - Overall Results 
            - SVM with Linear Kernel (cVals, Precision, Fscore, Recall, Accuracy)
            - SVM with RBF
            - SVM with Polynomial 
        PCA: 
            - Overall Results 
            - Dimensionality vs Explained Variance
            - PCA with SVM results (cVals, Precision, Fscore, Recall, Accuracy)
            - PCA with logistic regression (with both Regularization and no Regularization)
            
If we have time: 
- Neural Networks
