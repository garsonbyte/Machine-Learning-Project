# Machine Learning Project
Abstract: 
Roughly 60% of Americans claim to enjoy an occasional glass of wine, whether itâ€™sat a special dinner or at home.  Two of the most popular wines are red wine andwhite wine, which more than 60% of wine consumers drink.
Both  red  and  white  wines,  while  strikingly  different  in  appearance,  have  similardistributions of pH, sulfuric oxides, chlorides, and other elements.  The goal of ourproject is to apply machine learning algorithms to correctly classify a red or whitewine sample and to predict wine quality.  A dataset provided by UCI was used forour statistical analyses.  Preliminary steps included preprocessing the data into thedesired  form,  and  then  applying,  PCA  (Principal  Component  Analysis),  an  unsu-pervised learning algorithm to find trends in our unstructured data.  Afterwards, weimplemented three supervised learning algorithms (Polynomial Regression, LogisticRegression, and Support Vector Machines) to test the accuracy of the predicted re-sults.
Another  goal  of  our  project  was  to  illustrate  the  effect  of  regularization  and  fea-ture  transformation  on  our  data.   Lasso  (L1)  and  Ridge  (L2)  regularization  wereapplied  to  the  linear  and  logistic  regression  models.   Three  different  kernels  wereused and compared within our SVM model.
